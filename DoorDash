Write a SQL query to calculate the % of high-frequency customers for January 2023. A high-frequency customer is defined as someone who places more than 5 orders in a month. Your output should only include the % of these high-frequency customers.

Round your results to 2 decimal points.

Solution:
with cte as(
select 
  customer_id,
  count(delivery_id) as cnt
from 
  delivery_order
where 
  extract(year from order_timestamp) = 2023
  and extract(month from order_timestamp) = 1
group by customer_id
)
select 
round((select count(customer_id) from cte where cnt > 5) * 1.0/ count(customer_id),2) as ratio
from cte
;
